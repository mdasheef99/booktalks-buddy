# Progress

## What works:
- Complete project setup and robust memory bank documentation
- Landing page and navigation flows
- Anonymous chat with username dialog and real-time discussions
- Book search and discovery
- **Advanced Book Club system:**
  - Club-specific user profiles (edit username, bio, favorite genres/authors, avatar upload)
  - Membership management (join, request to join, cancel request, leave club, admin/member roles)
  - Real-time updates for club details, members, and current book (Supabase Realtime)
  - Admin/member navigation (settings, member management, leave club, logout)
  - Discussion topics and navigation to topic details
  - Modern UI/UX: tabs, cards, icons, confirmation dialogs, robust error handling
  - API logic for profile and membership management (src/lib/api/profile.ts)
  - Deep Supabase integration for data, storage, and subscriptions
- Explore page with modular architecture
- Authentication and profile management
- Role-based access control and UI rendering
- Comprehensive error handling and feedback

## What's left to build:
- Expand reading history and book tracking features in profiles
- Add more granular admin/moderator roles and permissions
- Continue UI/UX polish and accessibility improvements
- Increase test coverage for new Book Club features
- Event scheduling and management
- Monitor Supabase performance and optimize queries/subscriptions

## Current status:
- Book Club system is mature, supporting advanced profiles, membership management, and real-time collaboration
- All major Book Club features are implemented and integrated
- Supabase integration is deep and reliable for all Book Club features
- Modern, responsive UI/UX throughout Book Club flows
- No critical errors in console; development server running smoothly

## Known issues:
- Some UI/UX polish and accessibility improvements still needed
- Explore Page: duplicate headers and missing back button (pending refactor)
- React Query error: "No QueryClient set, use QueryClientProvider to set one" (to be addressed after UI fixes)
- Further testing needed for edge cases in membership and profile management

## Evolution of project decisions:
- Evolved from MVP to a mature Book Club system with deep personalization and real-time collaboration
- Centralized profile and membership management via Supabase
- Modular, extensible architecture for future enhancements
- Focus on robust error handling, user feedback, and modern UI/UX patterns
