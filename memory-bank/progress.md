# Progress (Updated 2025-04-28)

## What works:
- Complete project setup and robust memory bank documentation
- Landing page and navigation flows
- **Chat System (Anonymous & General):**
  - Username dialog and real-time discussions.
  - Refactored `ExploreBooks` page with modular components (Previous Update).
  - **Performance Optimization (Latest):**
    - Reduced re-renders using `useCallback` in `useBookDiscussion` hook for handlers.
    - Reduced re-renders using `React.memo` on key components (`MessageItem`, `BookDiscussionContainer`, `BookDiscussionHeader`, etc.).
  - **Functional Enhancements (Previous):**
    - Comprehensive error handling implemented.
    - Improved emoji reactions (count display, user list tooltip, remove instructions).
    - Disabled reactions/replies for deleted messages.
    - Added anonymous chat profile (`SimpleProfileForm`).
    - Implemented real-time presence tracking for online users.
    - Ensured separation of anonymous chat from book club features.
- Book search and discovery (integrated into `ExploreBooks`)
- **Advanced Book Club system:**
  - Core features: Club-specific profiles (editing, bio expansion), membership management (join, request, roles), real-time updates (Supabase), admin/member navigation, discussion topic listing.
  - **Refactored Components (Previous Update):**
    - `AdminJoinRequestsPage` (using `JoinRequestCard`, `JoinRequestFilters`, `useJoinRequestsFiltering` hook, etc.)
    - `BookClubDetailsWithJoin` (using section components like `ClubHeader`, `MembersSection`, `DiscussionsSection`, and hooks like `useClubDetails`, `useClubMembership`)
  - **Recent UI/Navigation Refinements:**
    - Fixed back buttons (`BookClubDetailsPage`, `EnhancedProfilePage`, general routing).
    - Removed duplicate elements ("Club Settings" button, `BookConnectHeader` on profile/club pages).
    - Improved login popup (added links).
    - Standardized `/book-clubs` route redirect.
    - Enhanced `EnhancedProfilePage` UI (button placement, bio expansion, header color).
    - Added back button to Create Book Club form.
  - **API Improvements:**
    - More robust error handling in `getUserClubMemberships` (non-blocking `current_books` fetch).
    - Added Google Books API key support (fixing rate limits).
  - Deep Supabase integration (data, storage, subscriptions).
- **Authentication and Profile Management:**
  - Core authentication via Supabase Auth.
  - Enhanced profile page (`EnhancedProfilePage`) with recent UI tweaks.
  - **Recent Enhancements:**
    - Implemented display name support (profiles & discussions).
    - Fixed profile data fetching for viewing other users.
    - Fixed profile links to use correct page (`BookClubProfilePage` with ID).
    - Refactored `EnhancedProfilePage` into smaller components (Previous Update).
- Role-based access control (Route Guards) and UI rendering.
- Comprehensive error handling and feedback (further improved recently across chat & profiles).

## What's left to build:
- Expand reading history and book tracking features in profiles.
- Add more granular admin/moderator roles and permissions.
- Continue UI/UX polish and accessibility improvements (beyond recent fixes).
- Increase test coverage (especially for refactored components/hooks).
- Event scheduling and management.
- Monitor Supabase performance and optimize queries/subscriptions.
- Address remaining known issues (see below).

## Current status:
- Book Club system is mature and functionally complete.
- **Chat system performance optimized** for anonymous discussions, reducing re-renders during real-time updates.
- Chat system functionally enhanced (previously) with error handling, improved reactions, anonymous profiles, and presence tracking.
- Key components (`AdminJoinRequestsPage`, `BookClubDetailsWithJoin`, `ExploreBooks`) are significantly refactored, improving maintainability (from previous updates).
- Anonymous chat is functional, optimized, and enhanced within the new `ExploreBooks` structure.
- **Profiles enhanced** with display names and fixes for data fetching/linking.
- UI/UX is refined, especially navigation consistency, profile layout, and removal of duplicate elements.
- Supabase integration is deep and reliable.
- API resilience improved (profile data fetching, Google Books API key).
- No critical errors in console; development server running smoothly.

## Known issues:
- Some general UI/UX polish and accessibility improvements still needed.
- Explore Page: Header/navigation consistency needs verification after recent anonymous chat profile/presence changes.
- React Query error: "No QueryClient set, use QueryClientProvider to set one" (to be addressed).
- Further testing needed for edge cases in membership, profile management, chat features (reactions, presence), and refactored components.

## Evolution of project decisions:
- Evolved from MVP to a mature Book Club system.
- **Latest focus (Late April 2025):** Performance optimization of the **Anonymous Chat System** using React memoization techniques (`useCallback`, `React.memo`).
- **Previous focus (Late April 2025):** Significant functional enhancements to the **Chat System** (error handling, reactions, anonymous profiles/presence) and **Profile/UI Refinements** (display names, data fetching, navigation fixes, API key).
- **Previous focus (Mid April 2025):** Major refactoring of key components (`AdminJoinRequestsPage`, `BookClubDetailsWithJoin`, `ExploreBooks`) for maintainability and structure. Simultaneous refinement of UI/UX (navigation, layout fixes).
- Centralized profile/membership management via Supabase.
- Modular, extensible architecture further enhanced by refactoring.
- Continued focus on robust error handling, user feedback, and modern UI/UX patterns.
