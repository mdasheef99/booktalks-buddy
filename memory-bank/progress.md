  - Write unit tests for UI components
  - Write integration tests
  - Test Supabase Realtime integration
  - Test RLS policies
  - Deploy to production
- Event scheduling and management

## Current status:
- Landing page errors resolved.
- Investigating and resolving UI issues on the Explore page: duplicate headers with identical design and missing back button.
- React Query issue investigation is paused until these Explore page UI issues are resolved.
- Book Club database schema and RLS completed.
- Book Club backend API endpoints implemented.
- **Book Club frontend UI components implemented and integrated.**
- **Basic Book Club list is loading, but needs further testing and UI improvements.**
- **Real-time discussion updates implemented in components.**

## Known issues:
- **Explore Page UI Issues:** Duplicate headers with identical design and a missing back button on the Explore page.
- **React Query Error:** "No QueryClient set, use QueryClientProvider to set one" when accessing features using React Query hooks (e.g., ExploreBooks page). Requires setting up `QueryClientProvider` at the application root (to be addressed after Explore page UI issues).
- **Book Club list is loading, but needs full UI and functionality testing.**

## Evolution of project decisions:
- Initially considered using a different backend framework, but decided to go with Node.js and Express.js (or Supabase Functions).
- Decided to use Supabase for backend services.
- Added Three.js for interactive 3D components (Decision Reversed: This feature has been removed).
- Implementing asset verification system for development (No longer relevant after 3D removal).
- Identified need for React Query for data fetching and state management.
- Implemented Book Club features using modular component architecture.
- Added real-time updates for discussions using Supabase Realtime.
- Chose Tailwind CSS and Radix UI for consistent styling.
