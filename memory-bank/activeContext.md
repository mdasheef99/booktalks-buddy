# Active Context

## Current Work Focus:
Resolving UI issues on the Explore page: duplicate headers with identical design and missing back button.

## Recent Changes:
- Removed the entire 3D interactive book feature based on user request.
  - Deleted `src/components/books/interactive/` directory.
  - Deleted `src/components/landing/InteractiveBookSection.tsx`.
  - Deleted `src/pages/InteractiveChatEntry.tsx`.
  - Deleted `public/textures/` directory.
  - Removed `three`, `@react-three/fiber`, `@react-three/drei` dependencies from `package.json`.
  - Updated `src/pages/Landing.tsx` to remove references and state related to the interactive book.
  - Updated `src/App.tsx` to remove the import and route for `InteractiveChatEntry`.
- Fixed the "Start anonymous chat" button functionality on the Landing page (`HeroSection`) to correctly open the `UsernameDialog`.
  - Added `handleOpenUsernameDialog` function in `Landing.tsx`.
  - Passed the handler to `HeroSection`.

## Next Steps:
- Investigate and resolve UI issues on the Explore page: duplicate headers with identical design and missing back button.
- Test the Explore page functionality to ensure the issues are resolved.
- Re-evaluate the React Query issue mentioned previously once the landing page errors are fixed.

## Active Decisions and Considerations:
- **Thorough Cleanup:** Ensure all traces of the removed 3D feature are eliminated to prevent residual errors.
- **Error Boundaries:** Reiterate the need for error boundaries, especially around complex UI sections, to gracefully handle unexpected issues.
- **React Query Setup:** Keep the previous note about `QueryClientProvider` setup, as it will likely be the next focus after fixing the current errors.
- **Explore Page UI:** Prioritize fixing the duplicate headers and missing back button on the Explore page.

## Important Patterns and Preferences:
- **Centralized Providers:** Keep context providers (like AuthProvider, QueryClientProvider) near the application root (`main.tsx` or `App.tsx`) for clarity and proper scoping.
- **Hook Usage:** Ensure React Query hooks are only used within components wrapped by the `QueryClientProvider`.

## Learnings and Project Insights:
- Removing significant features requires careful cleanup of components, routes, state, and dependencies to avoid runtime errors.
- Core library providers (like React Query's) must be correctly configured at the application root to function properly.
