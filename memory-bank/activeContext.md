# Active Context - Chat Performance Optimization & Refinements (Updated 2025-04-28)

---

## Recent Changes (Last ~1-2 Weeks)

- **Chat System Performance Optimization (Latest):**
  - **Goal:** Reduce unnecessary re-renders in the anonymous chat (`BookDiscussion` page) caused by real-time updates.
  - **Implementation:**
    - Memoized callback functions (`handleSendMessage`, `handleReplyToMessage`, `handleCancelReply`) in `useBookDiscussion` hook using `useCallback` to provide stable references.
    - Memoized key UI components (`MessageItem`, `BookDiscussionContainer`, `BookDiscussionHeader`, `BookDiscussionChat`, `BookDiscussionInput`) using `React.memo` to prevent re-renders when props haven't changed.
  - **Outcome:** Improved rendering performance and responsiveness of the anonymous chat interface.

- **Chat System Enhancements & Fixes (Previous):**
  - Implemented comprehensive error handling throughout the chat service.
  - Improved emoji reactions: Fixed count display, added user list tooltip with remove instructions.
  - Disabled reactions and replies for deleted messages.
  - Added anonymous chat profile (`SimpleProfileForm`) and real-time presence tracking, ensuring separation from book club features.

- **Profile Enhancements & Fixes (Previous):**
  - Implemented display name support in user profiles and discussions.
  - Fixed profile data fetching issues when viewing other users' profiles.
  - Fixed user profile links to correctly use `BookClubProfilePage` with the user ID.
  - Added back button to the Create Book Club form UI.
  - **Profile Page (`EnhancedProfilePage`) UI Tweaks:**
    - Buttons (Edit Profile, Create Club) moved to top-right.
    - Added consistent "Back to Book Clubs" button, removed duplicate header.
    - Added bio expansion/collapse for long bios.
    - Fixed `ChevronDown`/`ChevronUp` icon import.

- **API & Integration Fixes (Recent):**
  - Added Google Books API key support to address rate limiting issues.
  - `src/lib/api/profile.ts`: Improved error handling in `getUserClubMemberships` specifically for fetching `current_books` (now non-blocking).

- **UI/UX & Navigation Fixes (Recent):**
  - **Book Club Navigation/Details:**
    - Fixed back button on `BookClubDetailsPage` to consistently navigate to the list page (`/book-club`).
    - Removed duplicate "Club Settings" button from navigation.
    - Standardized `/book-clubs` route to redirect to `/book-club`.
  - **Login Popup:** Improved with "Register" and "Forgot Password" links.
  - **Anonymous Chat (`ExploreBooks` Refactor - Previous Update):**
    - Removed old side panel structure.
    - Fixed display of duplicate books in "Currently Discussed" section.
    - Added refresh mechanism/button for "Currently Discussed".

- **Major Component Refactoring (Previous Update):**
  - `AdminJoinRequestsPage`: Refactored into smaller components and logic extracted to `useJoinRequestsFiltering` hook.
  - `BookClubDetailsWithJoin`: Refactored into modular section components and logic extracted to `useClubDetails` & `useClubMembership` hooks.
  - `ExploreBooks` (Anonymous Chat): Refactored using new components and hooks.

- **Core Book Club Features (Established):**
  - Advanced club-specific user profiles with editing.
  - Comprehensive membership management (join, request, cancel, leave, roles).
  - Real-time updates (club details, members, current book) via Supabase.
  - Admin/member navigation and role-based views.
  - Discussion topic listing and navigation.
  - Deep Supabase integration (data, storage, subscriptions).

## Current Status

- Core Book Club system is functionally complete and mature, supporting advanced profiles, membership, and real-time updates.
- **Anonymous Chat performance optimized:** Reduced re-renders via `useCallback` and `React.memo`, improving responsiveness during real-time updates.
- **Chat system significantly enhanced (previously):** Improved error handling, refined reactions, added anonymous profiles and presence tracking.
- Key components (`AdminJoinRequestsPage`, `BookClubDetailsWithJoin`, `ExploreBooks`) have been significantly refactored for better maintainability, readability, and structure (from previous updates).
- UI/UX has been refined, particularly navigation consistency (back buttons, route standardization), profile layout, and display name support.
- Anonymous chat functionality is improved, optimized, and integrated into the new `ExploreBooks` structure, now including profiles and presence.
- API error handling is more robust, especially in profile/membership data fetching. Google Books API usage is more stable due to API key implementation.
- Supabase integration remains central and reliable.

## Next Steps

- Expand reading history and book tracking features in profiles.
- Add more granular admin/moderator roles and permissions.
- Continue UI/UX polish and accessibility improvements (beyond recent fixes).
- Increase test coverage, especially for refactored components and hooks.
- Address remaining known issues (e.g., Explore Page header/back button, React Query error).
- Monitor Supabase performance and optimize queries/subscriptions.

- The Book Club system remains a core pillar, stable and feature-rich.
- Anonymous chat features are significantly improved, optimized, and integrated into the refactored Explore page.
