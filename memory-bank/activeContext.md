## Notes

- `.env.local` **must be kept out of version control** for security.
- Supabase credentials can be rotated if needed.
- The migration significantly improves maintainability and scalability.
- Authentication now relies solely on Supabase Auth metadata.
- Anonymous chat and Book Club user systems are intentionally separate.
- **Helper functions `is_club_member` and `is_club_admin` are assumed for RLS.**
- **Real-time updates require careful management of Supabase subscriptions.**
- **Role-based UI rendering depends on accurate role information from the API.**
- Loading issue resolved by ensuring user is a member of at least one club.
