## **2. System Architecture Overview**

### **Hybrid Integration Architecture Pattern**
The system implements a hybrid approach that combines the stability of existing moderation infrastructure with specialized account management interfaces. This pattern provides optimal balance between implementation speed and system design quality.

### **Core Components Integration**

#### **Database Layer Extensions**
The system extends the existing users table with minimal status tracking fields and adds a specialized club_suspensions table for granular suspension management. The existing moderation_actions table serves as the primary audit trail, maintaining consistency with current moderation workflows.

#### **Service Layer Architecture**
A new AccountManagementService integrates with the existing reportingService to provide specialized account operations while maintaining consistent audit trails. The service layer handles complex business logic including club ownership transfer, data cleanup orchestration, and subscription cancellation integration.

#### **User Interface Integration Points**
The system extends existing admin interfaces (AdminUserListPage, ModerationDashboard) with account management capabilities and adds a new account settings section to the user profile system (EnhancedProfilePage). This approach ensures UI consistency and leverages existing component patterns.

#### **Permission System Reuse**
The implementation leverages the existing entitlements system (CAN_MANAGE_USER_TIERS, store_administrators table) without requiring new permission frameworks. This maintains security consistency and reduces implementation complexity.

### **Integration with Existing Systems**

#### **Moderation System Integration**
The account management system extends the existing ModerationDashboard component with a new "User Management" tab and reuses the moderation_actions table for audit trails. The existing `reportingService.ts` provides `createModerationAction()` function that supports `'user_suspension'` and `'user_ban'` action types. The `ModerationAction` interface in `src/types/reporting.ts` includes all necessary fields including `duration_hours`, `expires_at`, and `severity` for comprehensive account management logging.

#### **Admin Management Integration**
The system enhances the AdminUserListPage with account status indicators and management actions, following the established pattern of the UserTierManager component. This provides familiar interfaces for administrators while adding new capabilities.

#### **Profile System Integration**
A new "Account Settings" tab is added to the EnhancedProfilePage, providing users with self-service deletion capabilities. The implementation follows existing profile management patterns and integrates with the current AuthContext for session management.

#### **Authentication System Integration**
The system extends the AuthContext to include account status checking, ensuring that suspended or deleted users are automatically signed out. This integration maintains security without requiring changes to the underlying Supabase authentication system.

## **3. Database Implementation Plan**

### **Schema Extension Strategy**
The database implementation follows a minimal extension approach that adds necessary fields to the existing users table and creates a specialized club_suspensions table. This strategy maintains referential integrity while minimizing migration complexity.

### **Users Table Modifications**
The users table receives five new columns to track account status and deletion information:
- **account_status**: TEXT field with CHECK constraint for 'active', 'suspended', 'deleted' values
- **status_changed_by**: UUID reference to users table for audit tracking
- **status_changed_at**: TIMESTAMPTZ for status change timestamps
- **deleted_at**: TIMESTAMPTZ for soft deletion tracking
- **deleted_by**: UUID reference for deletion audit trail

Performance indexes are added on account_status and deleted_at fields to optimize status queries and support efficient cleanup operations.

### **Club Suspensions Table Design**
A new club_suspensions table implements granular suspension tracking:
- **Composite Primary Key**: user_id and club_id combination with UNIQUE constraint
- **Expiration Support**: expires_at field for temporary suspensions
- **Activity Tracking**: is_active boolean for efficient querying
- **Audit Fields**: suspended_by, reason, suspended_at for complete tracking
- **Performance Indexes**: Optimized for user-centric and club-centric queries

### **Foreign Key Relationship Handling**
The implementation addresses existing foreign key relationships through strategic cleanup:
- **CASCADE DELETE**: payment_records, user_subscriptions automatically cascade
- **Manual Cleanup**: conversation_participants, direct_messages require explicit handling
- **Ownership Transfer**: book_clubs.lead_user_id requires succession logic
- **Membership Removal**: club_members requires explicit removal with notifications

### **Migration Approach**
Database migrations follow established patterns from existing migrations with proven rollback procedures:
1. **Transaction Safety**: Single-transaction migrations following `20250105_008_add_security_enhancements_CORRECTED.sql` pattern
2. **Conditional Constraints**: Use conditional foreign key creation pattern from existing migrations
3. **Index Strategy**: Follow performance indexing patterns from `20250105_004_add_performance_indexes.sql`
4. **Error Handling**: Implement `DO $$ BEGIN ... EXCEPTION WHEN OTHERS` pattern for graceful error handling
5. **Rollback Procedures**: Complete rollback capability following `AvatarRollbackOperations` patterns

### **Data Retention Implementation**
The 30-day retention policy uses soft delete timestamps with automated cleanup:
- **Soft Delete Marking**: deleted_at timestamp marks deletion initiation
- **Background Processing**: Scheduled jobs process expired soft deletes
- **Permanent Cleanup**: Hard deletion after retention period expires
- **Audit Preservation**: Deletion audit records maintained beyond retention period

---

## **4. API Implementation Specification**

### **Service Layer Design**
The API implementation centers around AccountManagementService that provides high-level account operations while integrating with existing services. The service layer coordinates between multiple data sources and handles complex business logic with comprehensive error handling.

### **Account Deletion API Design**
The deletion API supports both soft and hard deletion modes:
- **Soft Deletion**: Marks account as deleted with retention period
- **Hard Deletion**: Permanent removal with comprehensive data cleanup

  - Inform club members of leadership transition
- Handle edge cases:
  - Single-member clubs (archive or dissolve)
  - Clubs with no suitable successors

**Phase 3: Advanced Features (Priority: Low)**
- Member voting system for leader selection
- Graceful club dissolution procedures
- Advanced analytics for leadership effectiveness
- Integration with club management workflows

#### **Technical Implementation Approach**
1. **Extend AccountManagementService**: Add automatic transfer logic to existing deletion workflow
