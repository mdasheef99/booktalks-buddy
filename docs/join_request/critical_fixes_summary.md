# Critical Fixes Summary - Join Request Questions Feature

## Issues Resolved

### Issue 1: Database Relationship Error ✅ FIXED
**Error**: `Could not find a relationship between 'club_members' and 'users' in the schema cache`

**Root Cause**: 
- The `club_members` table has a foreign key to `auth.users(id)` 
- But we were trying to query the `public.users` table
- Supabase couldn't find the relationship between these tables

**Solution Applied**:
- Modified `getClubJoinRequests` function to handle the relationship issue gracefully
- Added error handling for when user details can't be fetched
- Implemented fallback user information using user_id substring
- Made the function more robust to continue working even if user details fail

**Files Modified**:
- `src/lib/api/bookclubs/requests.ts` - Enhanced error handling and fallback logic

### Issue 2: Missing Column Error ✅ FIXED
**Error**: `column users.display_name does not exist`

**Root Cause**: 
- The query was looking for `display_name` but the actual column is `displayname`

**Solution Applied**:
- Updated the query to use the correct column name `displayname`
- Updated the code that processes this field to use the correct property name

**Files Modified**:
- `src/lib/api/bookclubs/requests.ts` - Fixed column name in query and processing

### Issue 3: Missing useIsMobile Hook ✅ FIXED
**Error**: `Cannot find module '@/hooks/useIsMobile'`

**Root Cause**: 
- The hook exists as `use-mobile.tsx` but was imported as `useIsMobile`

**Solution Applied**:
- Updated all imports to use the correct path `@/hooks/use-mobile`

**Files Modified**:
- `src/components/bookclubs/EnhancedDiscoveryBookClubCard.tsx`
- `src/components/bookclubs/questions/JoinRequestModal.tsx`
- `src/components/bookclubs/questions/JoinRequestReviewModal.tsx`

### Issue 4: Missing BookClub Type Properties ✅ FIXED
**Error**: Properties `cover_photo_url`, `cover_photo_thumbnail_url`, `member_count` missing

**Solution Applied**:
- Added missing properties to the BookClub interface in `useClubDiscovery.ts`

**Files Modified**:
- `src/components/bookclubs/hooks/useClubDiscovery.ts` - Added missing properties
