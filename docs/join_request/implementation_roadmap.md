# Join Request Form Questions - Implementation Roadmap

## 4-Phase Implementation Plan

Following the established BookTalks Buddy development approach: **Database → Backend API → Frontend → Integration/Testing**

---

## **Phase 1: Database Schema & Infrastructure** 
*Estimated Duration: 1-2 days*

### 1.1 Database Schema Creation
- [ ] Create `club_join_questions` table with proper constraints

- [ ] Create necessary indexes for performance optimization
- [ ] Add database constraints and validation rules

### 1.2 Database Migration
```sql
-- File: 20250115_join_request_questions_schema.sql
-- Create questions table
-- Extend existing tables
-- Add indexes and constraints
-- Create RLS policies
```

### 1.3 Row Level Security (RLS) Policies
- [ ] Policy: Club leads can manage their club's questions
- [ ] Policy: Club leads can view join answers for their clubs
- [ ] Policy: Users can submit answers for join requests
- [ ] Policy: Prevent unauthorized access to sensitive data

### 1.4 Database Testing & Verification
- [ ] Test question CRUD operations
- [ ] Verify answer storage and retrieval
- [ ] Validate RLS policy enforcement
