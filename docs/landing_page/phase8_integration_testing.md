3. Sets up carousel with 6 books
4. Customizes hero quote and chat button
5. Creates promotional banners
6. Configures community showcase
7. Adds custom quotes
8. Views analytics dashboard
9. Validates landing page displays correctly

**Test Scenario 2: Section Hiding Logic**
1. Start with completely uncustomized store
2. Verify only default sections show (Hero, Events, Book Clubs, Footer)
3. Add carousel items - verify carousel appears
4. Add promotional banners - verify banners appear
5. Configure community showcase - verify section appears
6. Add custom quote - verify quote section appears
7. Remove all customizations - verify sections hide correctly

**Test Scenario 3: Content Management Lifecycle**

interface ImageOptimization {
  // Automatic WebP conversion
  convertToWebP: boolean;
  // Responsive image generation
  generateSizes: number[];
  // Compression quality
  quality: number;
  // Lazy loading implementation
  lazyLoading: boolean;
}
```

**Database Query Optimization**:
```sql
-- Optimized query for landing page data
WITH store_customization AS (
  SELECT * FROM store_landing_customization WHERE store_id = $1
),
active_carousel AS (
  SELECT * FROM store_carousel_items 
  WHERE store_id = $1 AND is_active = true 
  ORDER BY position
),
active_banners AS (
  SELECT * FROM store_promotional_banners 
  WHERE store_id = $1 AND is_active = true 
    AND (start_date IS NULL OR start_date <= now())
    AND (end_date IS NULL OR end_date > now())
  ORDER BY priority_order
)
SELECT 
  sc.*,
  COALESCE(json_agg(ac.*) FILTER (WHERE ac.id IS NOT NULL), '[]') as carousel_items,
  COALESCE(json_agg(ab.*) FILTER (WHERE ab.id IS NOT NULL), '[]') as banners
FROM store_customization sc
LEFT JOIN active_carousel ac ON true
LEFT JOIN active_banners ab ON true
GROUP BY sc.store_id;
```
