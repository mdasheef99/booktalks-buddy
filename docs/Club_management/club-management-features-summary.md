# Club-Level Management Features - Executive Summary

## Overview

This document provides an executive summary of all club-level management features for the BookConnect platform. These features are designed specifically for individual book club management, accessible to Club Leads and selectively to Moderators, maintaining clear separation from store-wide administrative functions.

**Key Distinction**: All features are club-scoped using `club_id` and operate independently for each book club, ensuring complete data isolation and management autonomy.
