# BookConnect Events Feature Testing Implementation Progress

## Overview

This document tracks the implementation progress of the testing strategy outlined in `docs/events_testing_strategy.md`. It provides a summary of what has been implemented, what is currently in progress, and what remains to be done.

## Test Utilities Implementation

- ✅ Created `src/tests/test-utils.tsx` with:
  - Mock AuthContext provider
  - QueryClient provider with proper configuration
  - Helper functions for rendering components and hooks
  - Factory functions for creating mock events

## Hook Tests Implementation

### Completed
- ✅ `useEvents` hook tests (src/hooks/__tests__/useEvents.test.ts)
  - Tests for initial loading state
  - Tests for successful data fetching
  - Tests for error handling
  - Tests for filtering and sorting
  - Tests for refresh functionality

- ✅ `useEventRealtime` hook tests (src/hooks/__tests__/useEventRealtime.test.ts)
  - Tests for initial state
  - Tests for subscription setup
  - Tests for event handling (INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE)
  - Tests for optimistic updates
  - Tests for cleanup on unmount

- ✅ `useEventNotifications` hook tests (src/hooks/__tests__/useEventNotifications.test.ts)
  - Tests for initial loading state
  - Tests for successful data fetching
  - Tests for error handling
  - Tests for marking notifications as read
  - Tests for refreshing notification count

### In Progress

### Not Started
- ❌ `useParticipantsData` hook tests
- ❌ `useParticipantsExport` hook tests

## Integration Tests

- ❌ Component integration tests
- ❌ Data flow tests

## End-to-End Tests

- ❌ Store Owner Journey
- ❌ Club Member Journey
- ❌ Landing Page Visitor Journey

## Current Issues and Challenges

1. **Subscription Cleanup**: The `useEventNotifications` tests were failing due to issues with subscription cleanup in the unmount phase. The error was: `Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'unsubscribe')`. This has been fixed by:
   - Adding a null check in the cleanup function
   - Using a different testing approach with direct mock implementations

2. **Mock Consistency**: Need to ensure consistent mocking of the AuthContext and Supabase client across all tests.
   - For hooks that use AuthContext, we've found that mocking the entire hook rather than trying to mock the context is more reliable
   - This approach avoids issues with destructuring undefined values

3. **React 18 Compatibility**: Current tests show warnings about React 18 compatibility with the testing library. These are non-blocking but should be addressed in the future.

4. **Supabase Mocking**: There are errors in the useEvents tests related to Supabase mocking: `TypeError: __vite_ssr_import_2__.supabase.from(...).select(...).eq is not a function`. This suggests that the Supabase mock needs to be improved to better simulate the actual Supabase client behavior.

5. **Testing Approach for Hooks**: We've identified two effective approaches for testing hooks:
   - For simpler hooks: Create direct mock implementations that return the desired state
   - For stateful hooks: Create mock implementations that maintain state between renders

## Next Steps

Based on the testing strategy document, the next steps are:

1. **Complete Hook Tests**:
   - ✅ Fixed issues with `useEventNotifications` tests
   - Implement tests for `useParticipantsData` and `useParticipantsExport` hooks using the same approach

2. **Implement Integration Tests**:
   - Test component combinations (Events Page + API)
   - Test data flow (Event Creation → Notifications)

3. **Implement End-to-End Tests**:
   - Store Owner Journey
   - Club Member Journey
   - Landing Page Visitor Journey

## Conclusion

The implementation of the testing strategy is progressing well, with the foundational test utilities and three key hook tests completed. We've successfully addressed the subscription cleanup issues in the useEventNotifications tests and established a reliable pattern for testing hooks with complex dependencies.

The focus now is on implementing tests for the remaining hooks (useParticipantsData and useParticipantsExport) using the same approach before moving on to integration and end-to-end tests.

This incremental approach ensures that each layer of the application is thoroughly tested before moving on to more complex scenarios, following the testing pyramid concept outlined in the strategy document.
