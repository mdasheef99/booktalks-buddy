# Multi-Tier Profile Photo Implementation - BookTalks Buddy

## **Project Overview**

### **Feature Summary**
Implementation of a multi-tier profile photo system for BookTalks Buddy that generates three optimized image sizes during upload:
- **Thumbnail (100x100)**: Navigation bars, small UI elements, inline mentions
- **Medium (300x300)**: Book club member lists, discussion previews, card views
- **Full (600x600)**: Dedicated profile pages, high-quality display contexts

### **Strategic Benefits**
- **Performance Optimization**: Context-appropriate image sizes reduce bandwidth usage by ~60%
- **User Experience**: Faster loading times with progressive enhancement
- **Cost Efficiency**: Optimized for Supabase free tier constraints (1GB storage, 2GB bandwidth/month)
- **Scalability**: Smart loading strategy supports 1,000-2,000 user target
- **Quality Balance**: High-quality images where needed, optimized sizes elsewhere

### **Technical Approach**
- **Storage Strategy**: 354MB total storage for 1,200 users (35% of free tier limit)
- **Bandwidth Optimization**: 477MB monthly usage (24% of free tier limit)
- **Backward Compatibility**: Maintains existing avatar_url field for legacy support
- **Progressive Enhancement**: Initials-first loading with image overlay
