# BookTalks Buddy - Comprehensive Testing Session

## Overview
Conduct comprehensive Playwright MCP testing of BookTalks Buddy - an enterprise-grade book club platform with sophisticated role-based access control. **Playwright MCP is already installed and configured.**

## Previous Testing Summary
**Completed Tests**: Authentication (95% pass), Role validation (90% pass), Admin dashboard structure (blocked by route guard bug)
**Key Discovery**: Enterprise-grade system with 8-level role hierarchy, 35+ entitlements, multi-tenant architecture
**Critical Issue**: Route guard bug blocks admin access despite proper permissions - admin panel may load slowly or require retries

## Test Credentials
- **Store Owner**: `admin@bookconnect.com` / `admin123` (admin panel loads slowly)
- **Privileged+**: `plato@bc.com` / `plato123`
- **Privileged**: `kant@bc.com` / `kant123`
- **Member**: `chomsky@bc.com` / `chomsky123`
- **Member**: `aristotle@bc.com` / `aristotle123`

## Testing Strategy (Follow This Order)

### **Phase 1: Context Gathering (Do First)**
1. **Investigate entitlements system** - Login as each user, extract permissions from browser cache (sessionStorage)
2. **Analyze role differences** - Document what each role can access
3. **Map system architecture** - Understand role hierarchy and contextual permissions

### **Phase 2: Core Testing**
1. **Authentication flows** for all 5 users
2. **Role-based access validation** (admin panel, store management, club features)
3. **Feature coverage** (clubs, books, profiles, events)
4. **Cross-role comparisons** (privilege differences)

### **Phase 3: Comprehensive Validation**
1. **End-to-end workflows** (signup → club participation)
2. **Admin functionality** (if accessible after route guard issues)
3. **Integration testing** (books API, notifications, analytics)

## Key Investigation Areas

### **Entitlements Analysis (Critical)**
- Login as each user → Check browser console/sessionStorage for entitlements cache
- Expected structure: `{"entitlements": ["CAN_MANAGE_PLATFORM", ...], "roles": [...]}`
- Document permission differences between roles

### **Routes to Test**
- `/admin` (store owner - may need retries)
- `/book-clubs` (all users)
- `/profile` (all users)
- `/events` (check role differences)

### **Known System Architecture**
- **Role Hierarchy**: Platform Owner → Store Owner → Club Lead → Privileged+ → Privileged → Member
- **Entitlements**: 35+ permissions with contextual inheritance
- **Multi-tenant**: Store-specific contexts and permissions

## Instructions

### **Start Here (Critical)**
1. **Use Playwright MCP** (already installed) to create comprehensive tests
2. **Begin with entitlements investigation** - Login as each user and extract permissions from browser cache
3. **Gather context BEFORE writing tests** - Understand role differences and system capabilities
4. **Document findings** as you discover them

### **Testing Approach**
- **Use semantic selectors** (getByRole, getByText) for sophisticated UI
- **Handle admin panel delays** - Add retries/extended timeouts for store owner
- **Focus on role differences** - What can each user type access?
- **Test end-to-end workflows** across different user roles

### **Expected Outcomes**
- **Entitlements analysis** for all 5 user types
- **Role-based access validation**
- **Feature coverage** across membership tiers
- **Production readiness assessment**

**Goal**: Achieve comprehensive test coverage of this enterprise-grade platform with proper role-based validation.
