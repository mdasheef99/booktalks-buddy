- **Status**: ✅ **COMPLETED** (2025-01-23)
- **Template Analysis Required**:
  - [x] **Complete analysis** of `useStoreOwnerAccess.ts` structure and patterns
  - [x] **Document dependencies**: AuthContext, supabase, error handling patterns
  - [x] **Identify key changes**: role = 'manager', Store Manager entitlements mapping
  - [x] **Plan store context**: storeId, storeName retrieval with stores table join
- **Implementation Requirements**:
  - [x] Detect Store Manager role via `store_administrators` table (role = 'manager')
  - [x] Return store context (storeId, storeName) with proper error handling
  - [x] Validate Store Manager entitlements from STORE_MANAGER_ENTITLEMENTS

- **Testing**: [x] Route navigation and access control

### 🎯 Phase 1 Validation Summary (2025-01-23)

**✅ All Foundation Components Successfully Implemented and Tested**

#### **Critical Race Condition Fix Applied**
- **Issue**: Route guard was making redirect decisions before Store Manager access check completed
- **Root Cause**: `useStoreManagerAccess` hook was setting `loading: false` before React state updates were fully processed
- **Solution**: Added `hasChecked` flag to track definitive Store Manager access result
- **Result**: Store Manager (kafka@bookconnect.com) can now successfully access `/store-manager/*` routes

#### **Validation Results**
- **✅ Store Manager Authentication**: kafka@bookconnect.com properly configured in `store_administrators` table
- **✅ Database Integration**: Store Manager access query working correctly with store context retrieval
- **✅ Access Hook**: `useStoreManagerAccess` correctly detects Store Manager status and provides store context
- **✅ Route Guard**: `StoreManagerRouteGuard` properly protects routes and waits for access verification
- **✅ Layout**: `StoreManagerLayout` displays with terracotta theme and store context
- **✅ Placeholder Pages**: All 5 Store Manager pages accessible with store context displayed
- **✅ Routing Integration**: `/store-manager/*` routes properly integrated in App.tsx
- **✅ E2E Test Suite**: Comprehensive Playwright tests created for Store Manager access validation

#### **Store Manager Interface Foundation Ready for Phase 2**
- **Store Context**: Successfully provides Store ID (ce76b99a-5f1a-481a-af85-862e584465e1) and Store Name (Default Store)
- **Access Control**: Route protection working correctly with proper fallback handling
- **Navigation**: All Store Manager routes accessible and functional
- **Theme**: Terracotta visual theme properly applied and distinct from admin interface

## 🔧 CRITICAL ADMIN ACCESS FIX (2025-01-23)

**Target Completion**: Immediate (Same Day)
**Status**: ✅ **COMPLETED** (2025-01-23)
**Progress**: 1/1 critical fix

### Critical Issue Resolution
- [x] **File**: `src/pages/admin/AdminClubManagementPage.tsx`
- **Issue**: Store Managers could access admin clubs page but saw ALL platform clubs
- **Root Cause**: Missing store filtering for Store Manager role
- **Status**: ✅ **FIXED** (2025-01-23)
- **Solution Applied**:
  - [x] Added `useStoreManagerAccess` hook import
  - [x] Updated data fetching to filter by store ID for Store Managers
  - [x] Modified access control to allow Store Managers (`canManageAllClubs || isStoreManager`)
  - [x] Updated page title to show "Store Club Management" for Store Managers
  - [x] Added proper loading state handling for Store Manager access check

### Validation Results
- **✅ Store Manager Access**: kafka@bookconnect.com can access `/admin/clubs`
- **✅ Data Filtering**: Store Managers see only clubs from their store
- **✅ Security**: Store Managers cannot see clubs from other stores
- **✅ UI Updates**: Page title reflects Store Manager context
- **✅ Performance**: No additional database queries or performance impact

### Technical Implementation Details
```typescript
// Added store filtering logic
if (isStoreManager && !canManageAllClubs && storeId) {
  query = query.eq('store_id', storeId);
}

// Updated access control
const hasClubAccess = canManageAllClubs || isStoreManager;
```
