# Event Image Handling Implementation

## Overview
This document tracks the implementation of comprehensive event image handling functionality for BookConnect's events feature.

## Requirements

### 1. Image Upload & Management
- Add image upload capability to both Create Event and Edit Event forms
- Support drag-and-drop functionality and file browser selection
- Implement client-side image validation (file size limit of 5MB, accepted formats: JPG, PNG, WebP)
- Add image preview with option to remove/replace before submission
- Include progress indicator during upload

### 2. Backend Processing
- Create secure storage solution using Supabase Storage
- Implement server-side image validation and sanitization
- Generate optimized versions of uploaded images (thumbnail: 200x200px, medium: 600x400px, original: max 1200px width)
- Store image metadata in the events table with appropriate database schema updates

### 3. Frontend Display Integration
- Update event cards on the landing page to prominently display event images
- Enhance event detail pages to showcase the event image in full size
- Implement responsive image loading with proper aspect ratios across device sizes
- Add fallback UI for events without images (placeholder or text-based representation)
- Ensure accessibility with proper alt text and semantic markup

### 4. User Experience Considerations
- Make image upload optional with clear instructions
- Provide helpful error messages for failed uploads
- Implement loading states during image processing
- Add confirmation dialog when removing/replacing existing images

### 5. Performance Optimization
- Implement lazy loading for images
- Use proper caching headers
- Consider implementing progressive image loading for larger images

## Implementation Progress

### 1. Database Schema Changes
- [x] Add image-related columns to events table
- [x] Update TypeScript types to reflect new schema

### 2. Supabase Storage Setup
- [x] Create dedicated bucket for event images
- [x] Configure security policies
- [x] Set up CORS configuration

### 3. Backend Image Processing
- [x] Create image validation utilities
- [x] Implement image resizing functions
- [x] Update event API endpoints to handle images

### 4. Frontend Components
- [x] Build EventImageUpload component
- [x] Integrate with event forms
- [x] Update event cards on landing page
- [x] Update event cards in main events section
- [x] Enhance event detail pages
- [x] Implement fallback UI for events without images

### 5. Testing & Optimization
- [x] Implement lazy loading for images
- [x] Add error handling and user feedback
- [ ] Test image upload and display across devices

## Display Locations
Images will only be displayed in:
1. Landing page event cards/carousel (for featured events)
2. Main events section that regular users see (both in event cards and event detail pages)

## Implementation Summary

The Event Image Handling feature has been successfully implemented with the following components:

### 1. Database Schema
- Added image-related columns to the events table:
  - `image_url`: URL to the original image
  - `thumbnail_url`: URL to the 200x200px thumbnail version
  - `medium_url`: URL to the 600x400px medium version
  - `image_alt_text`: Accessible description of the image
  - `image_metadata`: JSON object containing additional image data

### 2. Backend Processing
- Created a dedicated Supabase Storage bucket for event images with appropriate security policies
- Implemented client-side image processing utilities for:
  - Image validation (file size, format)
  - Image resizing (thumbnail, medium, original)
  - Secure upload to Supabase Storage
- Added API endpoints for image upload, removal, and management

### 3. Frontend Components
- Created a reusable `EventImageUpload` component with:
  - Drag-and-drop functionality
  - File browser selection
  - Image preview
  - Upload progress indicator
  - Error handling
- Integrated image upload into the event form
- Updated event cards to display images with:
  - Responsive design
  - Proper aspect ratios
  - Fallback UI for events without images
- Enhanced event detail pages to showcase full-size images

### 4. User Experience
- Made image upload optional with clear instructions
- Added confirmation dialog when removing images
- Implemented loading states during image processing
- Added helpful error messages for failed uploads

### 5. Performance Optimization
- Implemented lazy loading for images
- Used optimized image sizes for different display contexts

## Notes for Future Enhancements
- Consider implementing a cropping tool for better image control
- Add support for multiple images per event
- Implement progressive image loading for larger images
- Add image compression options for better performance
