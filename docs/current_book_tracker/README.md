# Current Book Reading Update Feature

## Overview

The Current Book Reading Update feature enables book club members to track and share their reading progress for the club's current book. This feature provides a lightweight, privacy-focused solution that integrates seamlessly with the existing BookTalks Buddy book club system.

## Key Features

- **Progress Tracking**: Three status levels (Not Started, Reading, Finished)
- **Flexible Input**: Support for percentage completion OR chapter/page numbers
- **Privacy Controls**: User-controlled public/private visibility settings
- **Reading Notes**: Optional personal notes (500 character limit)
- **Real-time Updates**: Live progress updates across all club members
- **Feature Toggle**: Club leads can enable/disable progress tracking for their clubs
- **Mobile Responsive**: Touch-friendly interface optimized for all devices

## Requirements Summary

### Functional Requirements
- Members can update reading progress for current book only
- Progress visible to other club members (respecting privacy settings)
- Real-time synchronization across all connected clients
- Integration with existing MembersSection and CurrentBookSection components
- Club-level feature enablement controlled by club leads

### Non-Functional Requirements
- Database queries under 100ms for typical operations
- Real-time updates delivered within 2 seconds
- Support for clubs with up to 100 members efficiently
- Operates within Supabase free tier constraints
- Mobile-first responsive design

### Privacy & Security
- **Privacy-First Design**: No administrative override of user privacy settings

2. **Privacy Control Service**: Enforce user privacy preferences
3. **Feature Toggle Service**: Manage club-level feature enablement
4. **Real-time Coordination Service**: Handle live updates and subscriptions
