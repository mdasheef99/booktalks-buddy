7. User enters progress value (e.g., 25% or Chapter 3/12)
8. User optionally adds reading notes
9. User sets privacy preference (public/private)
10. User clicks "Save Progress"
11. Modal closes, progress appears in member list
12. Other members see real-time update (if public)

**Success Criteria**: Progress is saved and visible according to privacy settings

## Mobile Interaction Patterns

### Progress Update Modal on Mobile

**Design Considerations**:
- Full-screen modal on devices < 768px width
- Large touch targets (minimum 44px)
- Simplified layout with stacked elements
- Touch-friendly progress slider

**Interaction Flow**:
1. **Modal Opening**: Slides up from bottom of screen
2. **Status Selection**: Large radio buttons with clear labels
3. **Progress Input**: 
   - Percentage: Large slider with haptic feedback
   - Chapter/Page: Number inputs with +/- buttons
4. **Notes**: Expandable textarea with character counter
5. **Privacy Toggle**: Large switch with clear labels
6. **Save/Cancel**: Full-width buttons at bottom

### Member List on Mobile

**Design Considerations**:
- Compact progress indicators (24px diameter)
- Touch-friendly tap targets
- Swipe gestures for additional actions
- Responsive typography

**Interaction Patterns**:
- **Tap**: Show progress details in tooltip/popover
- **Long Press**: Quick actions menu (future enhancement)
- **Swipe**: Navigate between member details (future enhancement)

## Privacy Control Workflows

### Setting Progress Privacy

**User Story**: As a club member, I want to control who can see my reading progress

**Workflow**:
1. User opens progress update modal
2. User sees privacy toggle with clear labels:
   - "Public - Visible to all club members"
   - "Private - Only visible to me"
3. User selects preferred privacy setting
4. Privacy preference is saved with progress
5. Progress visibility updates immediately in member list

### Viewing Privacy-Controlled Progress

**User Story**: As a club member, I want to see what progress information is available to me

**Workflow**:
1. User views member list
2. For each member:
   - **Public Progress**: Shows actual progress with details
   - **Private Progress**: Shows lock icon with "Private" label
   - **Own Progress**: Always shows full details regardless of privacy setting
3. Hover/tap tooltips provide additional context

---

## Feature Toggle Workflows

### Enabling Progress Tracking (Club Lead)

**User Story**: As a club lead, I want to enable progress tracking for my club

**Workflow**:
1. Club lead navigates to club management section
2. Lead sees "Progress Tracking" section with toggle control
3. Lead clicks "Enable Progress Tracking"
4. Confirmation dialog explains feature benefits
5. Lead confirms enablement
6. Feature becomes available to all club members
7. Members see progress options appear in club interface

### Disabling Progress Tracking (Club Lead)

**User Story**: As a club lead, I want to disable progress tracking if it's not useful

**Workflow**:
1. Club lead accesses progress tracking settings
2. Lead clicks "Disable Progress Tracking"
3. Warning dialog explains that existing progress will be hidden (not deleted)
4. Lead confirms disabling
5. Progress features disappear from member interface
6. Existing progress data remains in database but is not displayed

---

## Error Handling Flows

### Network Connection Issues

**Scenario**: User loses internet connection while updating progress

**Flow**:
1. User submits progress update
2. Network request fails
3. UI shows "Connection lost" message
4. Progress update is queued locally
5. When connection returns, update is automatically retried
6. Success/failure notification shown to user

### Validation Errors

**Scenario**: User enters invalid progress data

**Flow**:
1. User enters invalid data (e.g., negative page numbers)
2. Client-side validation catches error immediately
3. Field highlights in red with specific error message
4. Submit button remains disabled until errors are fixed
5. User corrects data and submits successfully

### Permission Errors

**Scenario**: User tries to access feature without proper permissions

**Flow**:
1. User attempts to update progress
2. Server returns permission error
3. UI shows friendly error message: "You need to be a club member to track progress"
4. User is redirected to appropriate action (join club, etc.)

### Real-time Update Failures

**Scenario**: Real-time subscription fails or disconnects

**Flow**:
1. Subscription connection is lost
2. UI shows subtle "Reconnecting..." indicator
3. System attempts automatic reconnection
4. If reconnection fails, fallback to periodic refresh
5. User can manually refresh to get latest updates

---

## Accessibility Considerations

### Screen Reader Support
- All progress indicators have descriptive aria-labels
- Modal dialogs properly announce content and focus management
- Form fields have clear labels and error associations

### Keyboard Navigation
- All interactive elements accessible via keyboard
- Logical tab order through modal and page elements
- Escape key closes modals, Enter key submits forms

### High Contrast Support
- Progress indicators maintain visibility in high contrast mode
- Color is not the only indicator of progress status
- Text alternatives provided for all visual elements

### Motor Accessibility
- Large touch targets for mobile users
- Alternative input methods for progress entry
- Reduced motion options for animations

---

## Edge Case Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Book Changes While User Has Progress

**Context**: Club lead changes current book while members have existing progress

**Flow**:
1. Club lead selects new current book
2. System detects existing progress for previous book
3. Previous progress becomes "archived" (hidden from main view)
4. Members see fresh progress tracking for new book
5. Optional: Members can view their reading history in profile

### Scenario 2: User Leaves and Rejoins Club

**Context**: Member leaves club and later rejoins

**Flow**:
1. User leaves club
2. Progress records are soft-deleted (marked as inactive)
3. User rejoins club
4. If same book is still current, progress can be restored
5. If different book, user starts fresh progress tracking

### Scenario 3: Multiple Concurrent Updates

**Context**: User updates progress from multiple devices simultaneously

**Flow**:
1. User opens progress modal on Device A
2. User opens progress modal on Device B
3. User submits update from Device A
4. Device B receives real-time update and shows conflict warning
5. User on Device B can choose to overwrite or cancel
6. Last update wins with timestamp validation

## Performance Considerations

### Large Club Optimization

**Challenge**: Clubs with 50+ members may have performance issues

**Solutions**:
- Paginated member lists with progress indicators
- Lazy loading of progress details
- Efficient database queries with proper indexing
- Real-time subscription optimization

### Mobile Performance

**Challenge**: Mobile devices may struggle with real-time updates

**Solutions**:
- Reduced update frequency on mobile
- Optimistic UI updates for immediate feedback
- Background sync when app regains focus
- Graceful degradation for older devices
