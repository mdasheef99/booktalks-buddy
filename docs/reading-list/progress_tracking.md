## Notes and Decisions

### Architecture Decisions
- **Database Design**: Separate tables for reading list items and reviews for flexibility
- **Privacy Model**: Item-level privacy controls for granular user control
- **Integration Strategy**: Extend existing profile components rather than replace
- **API Design**: RESTful endpoints following existing codebase patterns

### Technical Decisions
- **State Management**: React Query for server state, local state for UI
- **Component Architecture**: Modular components with single responsibility
- **Error Handling**: Centralized error handling with user-friendly messages
- **Performance**: Aggressive caching with smart invalidation

### User Experience Decisions
- **Profile Integration**: Reading list as tab in profile viewing, section in profile editing
- **Review Workflow**: Integrated review creation within reading list interface
- **Privacy Controls**: Clear privacy indicators and easy privacy management
- **Mobile Experience**: Touch-friendly interface with responsive design
