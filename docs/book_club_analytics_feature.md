# Book Club Analytics Feature - Technical Specification

## Overview

This document outlines the implementation of a Book Club Analytics feature for the BookTalks Buddy admin panel. This feature provides store owners with insights about book club activities and book discussion trends among their customers.

## Feature Requirements

### Core Functionality
1. **Current Book Discussions Dashboard**: Display all books currently being discussed across book clubs
2. **Club Activity Metrics**: Show which clubs are most active in discussions
3. **Trending Books Analysis**: Identify books generating the most discussion
4. **Real-time Analytics**: Near real-time data updates for current activity
5. **Privacy Protection**: Only aggregate data from public clubs, respect privacy settings

### User Stories
- As a store owner, I want to see which books are currently being discussed in book clubs
- As a store owner, I want to identify trending books to inform my inventory decisions
- As a store owner, I want to understand club engagement levels
- As a store owner, I want privacy-safe insights that don't expose private club content

## Technical Architecture

### Database Layer

#### Existing Tables Used
- `book_clubs` (id, store_id, name, description, privacy, created_at, updated_at)
- `current_books` (club_id, title, author, book_id, set_at)
- `discussion_topics` (id, club_id, user_id, title, created_at, updated_at)
- `discussion_posts` (id, topic_id, user_id, content, created_at, updated_at)
- `club_members` (user_id, club_id, role, joined_at)

#### New Database Functions Needed
```sql
-- Function to get book club analytics for a store
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION get_store_book_club_analytics(
  p_store_id UUID,
  p_days_back INTEGER DEFAULT 30
) RETURNS TABLE (
  current_books_count INTEGER,
  active_clubs_count INTEGER,
  total_discussions_count INTEGER,
  total_posts_count INTEGER,
  avg_posts_per_discussion DECIMAL
);

-- Function to get current book discussions
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION get_current_book_discussions(
  p_store_id UUID
) RETURNS TABLE (
  book_title TEXT,
  book_author TEXT,
  book_id UUID,
  club_count INTEGER,
  total_discussions INTEGER,
  latest_activity TIMESTAMPTZ
);

-- Function to get trending books
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION get_trending_books(
  p_store_id UUID,
  p_days_back INTEGER DEFAULT 7
) RETURNS TABLE (
  book_title TEXT,
  book_author TEXT,
  book_id UUID,
  discussion_count INTEGER,
  post_count INTEGER,
  club_count INTEGER,
  trend_score DECIMAL
);
```

### API Layer

#### New Endpoints
**File**: `src/lib/api/store/bookClubAnalytics.ts`

```typescript
export interface BookClubAnalyticsSummary {
  currentBooksCount: number;
  activeClubsCount: number;
  totalDiscussionsCount: number;
  totalPostsCount: number;
  avgPostsPerDiscussion: number;
  period: string;
}

export interface CurrentBookDiscussion {
  bookTitle: string;
  bookAuthor: string;
  bookId: string | null;
  clubCount: number;
  totalDiscussions: number;
  latestActivity: string;
  clubs: Array<{
    id: string;
    name: string;
    memberCount: number;
  }>;
}

export interface TrendingBook {
  bookTitle: string;
  bookAuthor: string;
  bookId: string | null;
  discussionCount: number;
  postCount: number;
  clubCount: number;
  trendScore: number;
}

// API Functions
export async function getBookClubAnalyticsSummary(storeId: string, daysBack: number = 30): Promise<BookClubAnalyticsSummary>
export async function getCurrentBookDiscussions(storeId: string): Promise<CurrentBookDiscussion[]>
export async function getTrendingBooks(storeId: string, daysBack: number = 7): Promise<TrendingBook[]>
export async function getClubActivityMetrics(storeId: string, daysBack: number = 30): Promise<ClubActivityMetrics>
```

## Privacy & Security Considerations

### Privacy Safeguards
- Only aggregate data from public book clubs
- No access to private club discussion content
- No individual user identification in analytics
- Respect club privacy settings at all levels

### Data Access Controls
- Store owners can only see analytics for their own store
- Use existing store owner authentication
- Validate store ownership for all API calls
- No cross-store data leakage

### Performance Considerations
- Use database functions for complex aggregations
- Implement caching for frequently accessed data
- Add pagination for large datasets
- Use existing analytics infrastructure patterns
- Monitor query performance and optimize as needed

## Success Metrics

### Technical Metrics
- Page load time < 2 seconds
- API response time < 500ms
- Zero privacy violations
- 100% store isolation

### Business Metrics
- Store owner engagement with analytics
- Actionable insights provided
- User satisfaction with feature
- Performance impact on existing features

## Risk Assessment

### Low Risk
- Builds on existing proven patterns
