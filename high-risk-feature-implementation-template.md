## üìö LESSONS LEARNED REFERENCE

### Suspension System Failure Analysis
This template was created based on the critical failure of the suspension system implementation that caused infinite recursion bugs. Key lessons:

1. **Insufficient Context Analysis**: Failed to map existing entitlements caching system
2. **Ignored Existing Bugs**: Amplified pre-existing recursive cache issue
3. **Poor Integration Testing**: Didn't test with existing cache scenarios
4. **Missing Safeguards**: No circuit breakers or performance limits

### Prevention Principles
1. **Always map complete call graphs** before implementation
2. **Identify and fix existing bugs** before adding new features
3. **Implement circuit breakers** for any recursive-prone functions
4. **Test integration scenarios** with existing systems
5. **Add performance monitoring** to all critical paths

---

**Remember**: It's better to spend extra time on analysis than to cause critical system failures that take much longer to fix. This template enforces the rigorous process necessary to prevent the type of infinite recursion bugs that broke the profile page and overwhelmed the database.
