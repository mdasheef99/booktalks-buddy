## 📊 Test Architecture

### Page Object Model Pattern
- **Encapsulation**: All page interactions encapsulated in page objects
- **Reusability**: Common actions shared across test suites
- **Maintainability**: UI changes require updates in single location
- **Readability**: Tests focus on business logic, not implementation details

### Test Organization
- **Modular Structure**: Each refactored module has dedicated test suite
- **Priority-Based**: High priority tests run first
- **Independent Tests**: Each test can run in isolation
- **Comprehensive Coverage**: All user workflows and edge cases covered

### Error Handling Strategy
- **Graceful Degradation**: Tests handle missing features gracefully
- **Detailed Reporting**: Comprehensive error messages and screenshots
- **Retry Logic**: Automatic retries for flaky operations
- **Cleanup**: Proper test data cleanup after each test

## 🎯 Success Criteria Verification
