# BookTalks Buddy E2E Test Suite

Comprehensive end-to-end tests for the refactored BookTalks Buddy codebase, specifically designed to verify the Part 2 refactoring work (storeRequestsService.ts, BooksSection.tsx, and personalBooksService.ts).

## 🎯 Test Objectives

This test suite validates that the refactored modular architecture:
- ✅ Maintains 100% backward compatibility
- ✅ Preserves all existing functionality
- ✅ Handles cross-module integration correctly
- ✅ Provides proper error handling and user feedback
- ✅ Maintains performance and responsiveness

## 🧪 Test Suites

### 1. Backward Compatibility Tests
**File**: `backward-compatibility.spec.ts`
**Priority**: High

Verifies that refactored modules maintain 100% backward compatibility:
- Original import paths still work
- All previously available functions are accessible
- Component integration remains intact
- API contracts are preserved
- Error handling is maintained

### 2. Books Section Functionality Tests
**File**: `books-section-functionality.spec.ts`
**Priority**: High

Tests the complete user workflow in the refactored Books Section:
- Book search using Google Books API
- Adding books to personal library
- Managing reading lists and ratings
- Tab navigation (Search, Library, Store Requests, Collections)
- Loading states and error handling
- User feedback and notifications

### 3. Personal Books Service Tests
**File**: `personal-books-service.spec.ts`
**Priority**: High

Tests all CRUD operations for the personal books service:
- Google Books API integration
- Adding books to library from search results
- Viewing and managing personal book library
- Updating book details and ratings
- Removing books from library
- Library statistics and analytics
- Data persistence and synchronization

### 4. Store Requests Service Tests
**File**: `store-requests-service.spec.ts`
**Priority**: Medium

Tests the complete store request workflow:
- Creating authenticated store requests
- Viewing user's store requests
- Request status management
- Store context and user access validation
- Integration with personal library
- Request cancellation and updates

### 5. Cross-Module Integration Tests
**File**: `cross-module-integration.spec.ts`
**Priority**: High

Tests that refactored modules work together correctly:
- Data flow between search, library, and store requests
- State management across components
- Error handling across modules
- Performance and loading states
- User experience consistency
- Accessibility across modules

## 🚀 Running Tests

### Prerequisites

1. **Development Server**: Ensure the BookTalks Buddy development server is running
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

2. **Test Environment**: Set up test user credentials (optional)
   ```bash
   export TEST_USER_EMAIL="chomsky@bc.com"
   export TEST_USER_PASSWORD="chomsky123"
   ```

### Running All Tests

```bash
# Install Playwright if not already installed
npx playwright install

# Run all E2E tests
npm run test:e2e

# Run with custom test runner (recommended)
npx ts-node tests/e2e/run-tests.ts
```

### Running Specific Test Suites

```bash
# Run backward compatibility tests only
npx playwright test tests/e2e/tests/backward-compatibility.spec.ts

# Run Books Section functionality tests
npx playwright test tests/e2e/tests/books-section-functionality.spec.ts

# Run with specific browser
npx playwright test --project=chromium

# Run in headed mode (visible browser)
npx playwright test --headed

# Run with debug mode
npx playwright test --debug
```

### Running Tests in Different Environments

```bash
# Run against different base URL
npx playwright test --config=playwright.config.ts --base-url=http://localhost:3001

# Run with different viewport
npx playwright test --project="Mobile Chrome"

# Run with specific timeout
npx playwright test --timeout=120000
```

## 📊 Test Reports

### Automated Reports

Tests generate comprehensive reports in multiple formats:

1. **HTML Report**: `test-results/playwright-report/index.html`
2. **JSON Report**: `test-results/results.json`
3. **JUnit Report**: `test-results/results.xml`
4. **Custom Summary**: `test-results/summary.json`

### Viewing Reports

```bash
# Open HTML report
npx playwright show-report

# View custom summary
cat test-results/summary.json | jq
```

## 🔧 Configuration

### Test Configuration

Key configuration options in `playwright.config.ts`:

- **Base URL**: `http://localhost:3000`
- **Timeout**: 60 seconds per test
- **Retries**: 2 retries on CI, 0 locally
- **Browsers**: Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Mobile Chrome, Mobile Safari
- **Screenshots**: On failure only
- **Videos**: Retained on failure

### Environment Variables

```bash
# Test user credentials
TEST_USER_EMAIL=chomsky@bc.com
TEST_USER_PASSWORD=chomsky123

# Privileged user credentials
PRIVILEGED_USER_EMAIL=kant@bc.com
PRIVILEGED_USER_PASSWORD=kant123

# Admin user credentials
ADMIN_USER_EMAIL=admin@bookconnect.com
ADMIN_USER_PASSWORD=admin123

# Test environment
CI=true                    # Enable CI mode
PLAYWRIGHT_SKIP_BROWSER_DOWNLOAD=1  # Skip browser download
```

## 🐛 Debugging Tests

### Debug Mode

```bash
# Run in debug mode with browser visible
npx playwright test --debug

# Run specific test in debug mode
npx playwright test tests/e2e/tests/books-section-functionality.spec.ts --debug

# Run with trace viewer
npx playwright test --trace=on
```

### Common Issues

1. **Connection Refused**: Ensure development server is running on port 3000
2. **Authentication Failures**: Verify test user credentials are correct
3. **Timeout Errors**: Increase timeout in configuration or use `--timeout` flag
4. **Element Not Found**: Check if UI components have proper test IDs

### Test Data Management

Tests are designed to be independent and clean up after themselves:
- Each test starts with a fresh authenticated session
- Test data is created and cleaned up within each test
- No persistent test data should remain after test completion

## 📈 Success Criteria

Tests are considered successful when:

- ✅ **100% Backward Compatibility**: All original import paths work
- ✅ **Functional Completeness**: All user workflows complete successfully
- ✅ **Cross-Module Integration**: Data flows correctly between modules
- ✅ **Error Handling**: Graceful error handling and user feedback
- ✅ **Performance**: Responsive UI and reasonable load times
- ✅ **Accessibility**: Keyboard navigation and screen reader support

## 🔄 Continuous Integration

These tests are designed to run in CI/CD pipelines:

```yaml
# Example GitHub Actions workflow
- name: Run E2E Tests
  run: |
    npm ci
    npx playwright install --with-deps
    npm run test:e2e
```
